        <h3>JavaScript Basic - Tip calculator</h3>

        <p>Dasun and his friends went on a picnic. To get food they went to 3 different resturants
            for each meal. The bills are Rs.1230, Rs.982, Rs.1640.
        </p>
        <p>To tip the waiter a fair amount, Dasun created a simple tip calculator
            (as a function). He likes to tip
            <br>20% of the bill when the bill is less than Rs.1000,
            <br>15% when the bill is between Rs 1000 and Rs 1500, and the
            <br>10% if the bill is more than Rs 1500.
        </p>
        <p>In the end, Dasun would like to have 2 arrays:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Containing all 3 tips</li>
            <li>Containing all three final paid amount(bill+tip)</li>
        </ol>
